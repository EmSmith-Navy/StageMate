# StageMate Application PRD
**tl;dr:** A platform for venues to search for and discover musicians.
## Goals:
### User Goals:
- Enable venues to search for and discover musicians matching specific criteria such as genre and location.
- Facilitate an easy-to-use interface for managing artist leads using a kanban-style board.
- Provide a calendar UI for venues to manage bookings.
### Non-Goals:
- The platform will not facilitate direct booking transactions or contract negotiations between artists and venues.
- Avoid building advanced social networking features at this stage.
- Not aimed at non-musical performers or other entertainment industries.
## User Stories:
- As a venue, I want to search for artists by relevant information to find suitable talent faster, so that I can book shows for my patrons.
- As a venue, I want to manage my prospective artist leads in one place, so that I can operate more efficiently.
- As a venue, I want to view my booked shows on a calendar, so that I can manage bookings more easily.
## User Experience:
### Sign up and login: 
- Venues will sign up for an account. Venues will be asked for a venue name, first name, last name, email. Once an account is created, the user will be directed to the login page. Users will login and be directed to the search page. 
### Core Functionality Walkthrough:
- **Artist Search:** Users can search and filter for musicians based on certain dimensions such as genre, pricing, etc. Users can add artists to their prospect list.
- **Talent Management:** Users click on the talent board tab and view a kanban board with artist cards containing all information about the artist. Users are able to click an artist's card, which renders an artist modal displaying detailed information.
- **Calendar View:** Users can click on the calendar tab and view a calendar with events. Users can click into the event to update the artist modal, which is also the same modal within the kanban board. 
### UI/UX Considerations:
- Intuitive dashboard for kanban board usability (drag-and-drop for statuses).
- Clean and modern interface using card design.
